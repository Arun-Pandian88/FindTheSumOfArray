# Find The Sum Of Array

This Java program efficiently finds three elements in an array whose sum is equal to a specified value (`SumValue`). The solution utilizes nested loops to iterate through the array and identify the triplet that meets the sum condition.

## Features

- **Efficient Algorithm:** Uses a nested loop approach to find the triplet with the desired sum.
- **User Input Handling:** Takes user input for the size of the array, array elements, and the target sum.
- **Modular Design:** Organized into functions for improved readability and maintenance.

## How to Use

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the size of the array.
3. Input the array elements one by one.
4. Specify the target sum.
5. The program will identify and display a triplet whose sum matches the specified value.

## Example

```java
// Sample Input
Enter the Size: 5
Enter the Element: 1 2 3 4 5
Enter the SumValue: 9

// Output
3 + 4 + 5 = 12
```
